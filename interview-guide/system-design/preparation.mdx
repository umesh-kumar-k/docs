**Meta System Design Interview** (Pirate round, 45min) by ex-Meta interviewer: **No right answer**—tests **structured thinking + trade-offs + communication**. Collaborative whiteboard, iterate together.[1]

## Detailed Key Topics
**Core Philosophy**
- Perfect design ≠ goal. Real systems evolve via trade-offs.
- Interviewer = partner (ask/answer questions, co-iterate).
- Success = clear reasoning > memorized architectures.

**Phase Breakdown (45min)**
```
Phase 1 (5-7min): Requirements clarification
  - "DAU? Peak QPS? Latency SLA? Top 3 functional reqs?"
  - Prioritize: Must-haves vs nice-to-haves

Phase 2 (10min): High-level design
  - Boxes (services) + arrows (data flow)
  - Core components only (5-7 max)

Phase 3 (20min): Deep dives (pick 2-3)
  - Cache strategy (eviction, consistency)
  - DB choice (SQL ACID vs NoSQL scale)
  - Load balancer (health checks, failover)

Phase 4 (8-10min): Scale + failures
  - BOTEC: DAU → QPS → servers
  - "What breaks? How fix?"
```

## Common Mistakes (Detailed)
| Mistake | Why Fails | Fix |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| **Jump to drawing** | Wrong problem solved | 5min reqs clarification |
| **50 microservices** | No depth/time | 5-7 core components |
| **Silent whiteboard** | Can't follow thinking | "Choosing X because Y..." |
| **"Netflix uses Kafka"** | Memorization, no reasoning | "Kafka for [specific req]" |
| **No numbers** | Unrealistic scale | "100M DAU = 115K RPS" |

## Communication Framework (Verbatim Style)
```
1. State assumption: "Assuming 100M DAU peak hour..."
2. Propose solution: "I'll use Redis cache here because..."
3. Trade-off: "Downside: memory cost. Alternative: DB indexes slower."
4. Justify: "Redis wins for 95% hit rate on hot reads."
5. Diagram: Box+arrow+label (QPS, latency)
```

## Best Practices (Expanded)
**Think-Aloud Template**
```
"I'm considering [Option A] for [Requirement X] because [Reason Y]. 
Trade-off with [Option B]: [Pros/Cons]. 
Given [constraint Z], prefer A. Let me draw this..."
```

**Diagram Standards**
```
✅ Boxes = services (EventService, BookingService)
✅ Arrows = data flow (User→API→DB)
✅ Labels = scale ("100K QPS", "<200ms")
❌ Crowded diagrams, unlabeled arrows
```

**Proactive Depth**
- Self-identify bottlenecks: "DB will bottleneck writes → sharding by eventId."
- Ask interviewer: "Should I deep dive cache or DB first?"

## Interview Cheat Sheet (Q&A)
**Q: "Design newsfeed!"**  
A: "Requirements first: DAU? Personalization? Real-time? Top 3: Post/Read/Like."[1]

**Q: "Why Redis cache?"**  
A: "Hot reads (95% hit). TTL=1hr. Write-through consistency. Miss→DB."[1]

**Q: "100M DAU servers?"**  
A: "100 reqs/day/user = 10B reqs = 115K RPS. 64K RPS/server = 2 avg, 20 peak."[1]

**Q: "Single DB failure?"**  
A: "Master-slave async repl. Promote slave (15s). Read replicas throughout."[1]

**Pushback Response**: "Valid concern. Alternative: [X]. Still prefer original because [Y]."
