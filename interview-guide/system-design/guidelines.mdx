Uber's System Design & Architecture interview (Latin America) features two distinct rounds for Senior Architect roles: **New Problem** (whiteboard high-level architecture for large-scale app) and **Past Project** (deep dive into personal contributions/technical challenges).[1]

## Detailed Interview Structure
- **New Problem Round**: Build end-to-end architecture for massive-scale application (e.g., design Uber-scale service).
- **Past Project Round**: Present real-world project - focus on YOUR architecture decisions, challenges overcome, trade-offs made.
- **Format**: Both use whiteboard-style (Miro for diagrams, CodeSignal for any coding).
- **Duration**: 45-60 mins each; panel reviews diagrams post-interview.[1]

## Key Topics Section-Wise (Expanded)
### Preparation Phase
- **Tools Mastery**: Practice CodeSignal (coding), Miro (diagramming) - know shortcuts/hotkeys.
- **Diagram Types**: Component diagrams, data flow, sequence diagrams, deployment diagrams.[1]

### Interview Execution
1. **Clarify Requirements** (5 mins): Functional (features), non-functional (scale/latency), edge cases.
2. **Simple Solution** (10 mins): Single server → basic DB → naive storage.
3. **Scale Up** (15 mins): Load balancers → sharding → multi-region → caching.
4. **Deep Dive** (15 mins): Pick 1-2 components (e.g., DB choice justification).
5. **Trade-offs** (5 mins): Justify every major decision.[1]

## Uber-Specific Tradeoff Examples
| Dimension | Trade-off Examples | When to Choose |
|-----------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Consistency** | Strong (ACID SQL) vs Eventual (NoSQL) [1] | Strong: Money transfer; Eventual: Social feed |
| **Availability** | CAP theorem choices [1] | AP: Social media; CP: Banking |
| **Latency** | Cache everything vs Fresh data | Cache: Feeds; Fresh: Stock prices |
| **Storage** | SQL (joins) vs NoSQL (partitioning) [1] | SQL: Relationships; NoSQL: Scale |

## Detailed Best Practices
### Communication
- **Think Aloud Constantly**: "I'm considering X because Y, but Z is tradeoff..."
- **Lead Proactively**: Don't wait for questions - present alternatives yourself.
- **Justify Everything**: Tie decisions to clarified requirements.[1]

### Technical Approach
```
Simple → Scale → Optimize → Tradeoffs
┌─────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐    ┌──────────────┐
│ Single Node │───▶│ Sharded DB   │───▶│ Multi-Region │
│ Web/DB/FS   │    │ LB + Cache   │    │ CDN/Replica  │
└─────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └──────────────┘
```
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Start naive → production-ready → optimizations.

### Diagram Mastery
```
CRITICAL: Diagram = Hiring Artifact (Panel Review)
├── Components (boxes)
├── Data Flow (arrows)  
├── Scale Indicators (#servers, regions)
├── Caches/DBs (separate layers)
└── Tradeoff Notes (callouts)
```


## Advanced Senior Architect Signals
- **Deep Trade-off Knowledge**: Know when/why to choose SQL vs NoSQL beyond basics.
- **Production Concerns**: Monitoring, alerting, cost optimization, failure modes.
- **Don't Fake Uber Tech**: Use Kafka only if it fits - show genuine reasoning.[1]

## Interview Cheat Sheet (Q&A)
**Q: "How would you handle 1B users?"**  
A: "Phase 1: LB+sharded DB. Phase 2: Multi-region + CDN. Phase 3: Async processing + caching."

**Q: "Why SQL not NoSQL?"**  
A: "Need ACID transactions for X, join performance acceptable at Y QPS."

**Q: "Don't know something?"**  
A: "Never fake. Say: 'I'd approach with X or Y - which aligns better?'"

**Q: "How to show leadership?"**  
A: Proactively discuss 3+ alternatives per major component.[1]

## Key Terms & Keywords
- **Uber SD Interview**: New problem + past project, Miro diagramming, CodeSignal, progressive scaling.
- **Process**: Clarify reqs → simple → scale → deep dive → tradeoffs.
- **Evaluation**: Diagrams (panel review), think-aloud, tradeoff justification, leadership.
- **Tradeoffs**: Consistency/latency/availability (CAP), SQL/NoSQL, cache/freshness.[1]
