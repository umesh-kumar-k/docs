Angular Signals' **push/pull** model—producers **push** notifications, consumers **pull** values—explains behaviors across signals, computed (lazy pull), effects (eager poll→pull), and templates for zone/signals components. Expanded with **section-wise key points** from article for complete Senior Architect coverage.[1]

## Signal Fundamentals (Article Intro)
- Signals unify reactivity: pull via `()` (sync, multiple OK), push via `set()`/`update()` (notifies "changed", no value)[1]
- **Reactive Graph**: Getters track reads → consumers subscribe to producers[1]
- Quiz: `count()` twice → same value (pure function); `set()` notifies once[1]

## Computed Signals Section
**Key Points**:
- `computed(() => count() * 2)` lazy: 0 reads despite `set()` pushes[1]
- First `doubleCount()`: registers producers, computes/pulls[1]
- Subsequent `set()`: marks stale → recompute only on next pull[1]
- Batches: Multiple pushes → single pull with final value[1]

## Effects Section
**Key Points**:
- `effect(() => console.log(count()))`: Dirty initial → runs on create[1]
- Push marks dirty → on CD: poll producers → pull if changed → re-run[1]
- Quiz: Ctor `set(1); set(2)` → effect sees final 2 (batched)[1]
- Even computed +2: poll sees same → skip re-run[1]
- `onCleanup(fn)`, `DestroyRef` auto-cleanup[1]

## Templates Section
**Key Points**:
- Zone.js: Templates pull on CD (click → zone → pull signals)[1]
- Signals components (`signals: true`): Push-driven CD[1]
- Effect semantics: push → poll → pull for template refresh[1]

## Push/Pull Deep Dive Section
**Key Points**:
- **Push**: Only notification (RxJS multicasting)[1]
- **Pull**: Value retrieval (function-like)[1]
- Effects poll computed (skip unchanged), always pull base signals[1]

## Design Patterns & Best Practices
- **Reactive Graph**: Producers → consumers via tracking[1]
- Computed replaces `ngOnChanges`/BehaviorSubject; effects for side-effects[1]
- Batch sync `set()`: Single notification/pull[1]
- Effects prevent unnecessary API calls via polling[1]

## Advanced Topics
- **Polling Logic**: Computed unchanged → effect skips despite base signal push[1]
- Signals Components: Zone-less, push CD[1]
- Evolving: Check post-Dec 2023 impl, YouTube "Angular Signals In-depth"[1]

## Interview Cheat Sheet
**Q: Computed 0 runs despite `set()`?**  
A: Lazy—never pulled → no execution/registration[1]

**Q: Effect ctor `set(1); set(2)`?**  
A: Batched → single run with final value[1]

**Q: Even computed +2 skips effect?**  
A: Poll sees unchanged computed → abort[1]

**Q: Signals components CD?**  
A: `signals: true` → push-driven, zone-less[1]

**Q: Effect initial dirty run?**  
A: Always runs first regardless of value[1]
