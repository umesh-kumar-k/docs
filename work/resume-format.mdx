# ✅ Recommended **2-Page Resume Structure (Principal / Staff Level)**

## 🔹 PAGE 1 — *Impact, Identity, and Credibility*

This page decides whether you get the interview.

---

### 1️⃣ Header (Top, Compact)

```
Name
Principal Frontend / Full-Stack Architect
Location | Email | Phone | LinkedIn | GitHub (optional)
```

**Why:**
Immediately positions you at the **right seniority level**.

---

### 2️⃣ Professional Summary (3–4 lines) ✅ *YES, include this*

*(Not a generic objective — a positioning statement)*

**Example:**

> Senior Architect with 18+ years of experience modernizing enterprise-scale financial platforms. Frontend-first full-stack leader with deep expertise in Angular, UI platform architecture, security, and fixed-income systems used by large North American banks and hundreds of correspondent institutions.

**Why:**

* Helps recruiters in 5 seconds
* Frames everything that follows
* Especially important when switching between frontend and full-stack roles

---

### 3️⃣ Career Highlights (12–14 bullets) ✅ *Your compressed list*

* Use the **13-bullet version we created**
* Metrics-heavy
* Outcome-focused

**Why this goes before skills:**

* Highlights prove **you’ve already done the job**
* Skills then explain **how**

---

### 4️⃣ Hybrid Technical Skill Set (Grouped)

*(Frontend-heavy full-stack version)*

**Structure:**

* Frontend Architecture
* Backend & APIs
* Security & DevSecOps
* DevOps & CI/CD
* Data & Persistence
* Quality & Testing

**Why:**

* ATS-friendly
* Reinforces architectural depth
* Avoids a flat, junior-looking skills list

---

👉 **STOP PAGE 1 HERE**

This ensures page 1 answers:

* Who is this person?
* How senior are they?
* What impact have they had?
* Do they have the right technical depth?

---

## 🔹 PAGE 2 — *Depth, Proof, and Story*

This page supports interviews.

### 5️⃣ Work Experience (Detailed, Impact-Oriented)

#### FIS — Senior Architect

*(12+ years)*

Use **customer benefit + business benefit bullets**, grouped by theme:

* Platform Modernization
* Portfolio & Safekeeping Visualization
* Trading UI & STP
* Security, SSO & Compliance
* DevSecOps & CI/CD
* Integrations & Reliability

**Tips:**

* 6–8 strong bullets max
* Each bullet = *Problem → Action → Impact*

---

#### Previous Organization — Senior Engineer

*(6+ years)*

* Billing platforms
* Data model modernization
* Telenor implementation

Keep this **shorter**, but still impact-driven.

---

### 6️⃣ Education & Certifications (Bottom)

```
Degree | University
Certifications (only relevant ones)
```

**Why:**
At your level, this is **validation**, not the selling point.

## ❌ Sections You Should NOT Add (At Your Level)

| Section          | Why                              |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Objective        | Replaced by Professional Summary |
| Hobbies          | Not relevant                     |
| Soft Skills list | Show via impact                  |
| Tools dump       | Already covered in skills        |
| References       | “Available on request” (or omit) |

## 🧠 Why This Order Is Optimal

| Reader         | What they see first     | Why it works              |
| -------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| ATS            | Skills + keywords       | High match score          |
| Recruiter      | Summary + Highlights    | Fast seniority validation |
| Hiring Manager | Highlights → Experience | Impact + depth            |
| Interviewer    | Experience bullets      | Ready-made questions      |

---

## 🔥 Final Recommendation (Very Important)

**Do NOT change this order per application.**
Instead:

* Swap **Frontend-heavy vs Full-Stack skill section**
* Slightly tune **Professional Summary**

The structure stays the same.

---

## 📌 Final Verdict
