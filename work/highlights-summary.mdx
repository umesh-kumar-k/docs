# ✅ 2) **Language Tuning – Why This Reads as Principal / Staff Level**

Notice what’s different (and why it works):

* **“Led / Architected / Designed”** → signals ownership
* Focus on **systems, scale, and enablement**, not just features
* Metrics tied to **outcomes**, not tasks
* Frontend framed as a **platform** (SPA, APIs, security, CI/CD)

This avoids the “senior UI developer” trap and positions you as a **Frontend Systems Architect**.

# ✅ 3) **Spoken Interview Answers (Memorize These)**

## 🎤 60-Second “Tell Me About Your Role” Answer

> “For over 12 years, I’ve worked on FIS’s Fixed Income Processing Suite used by large North American banks and hundreds of correspondent institutions. I led the modernization of a legacy JSP/Struts portal into an Angular SPA backed by REST APIs, improving performance by 40–60% for thousands of users.

> Beyond UI modernization, I focused on turning complex fixed-income data into self-service dashboards, reducing operational reporting by over 50%. I’ve also owned cross-cutting concerns like SSO, security compliance, DevSecOps, and straight-through trading workflows. My role sits at the intersection of frontend architecture, platform security, and customer-facing financial systems.”

>
> This reduced manual reporting by over 50% and improved onboarding speed by 20–30%.

That combination of frontend architecture, domain depth, and measurable business impact is why I operate at a Principal level.”
