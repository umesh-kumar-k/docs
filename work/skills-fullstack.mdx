### ✔ ATS-Friendly

* Clear keyword clustering
* Repeats Angular, Java, Spring, CI/CD naturally

### ✔ Senior-Level Signal

* Skills are grouped by **capability**, not tools
* Shows architecture, not just implementation

### ✔ Role-Specific

* Frontend version emphasizes **UI platforms, performance, state, UX**
* Full-stack version emphasizes **end-to-end ownership**

# ⚠️ What NOT to Do (Common Mistake)

❌ Single long skills list
❌ Mixing Struts & Micro Frontends in same line without context
❌ Listing every tool equally

At your level:

> **Structure > Quantity**

# 🧠 Pro Tip (Very Powerful)

For **Frontend roles**, move:

* Angular
* Performance
* State management
  to the **top**

For **Full-Stack roles**, move:

Same skills — different emphasis.
