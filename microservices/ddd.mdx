Azure microservices domain modeling applies Domain‑Driven Design (DDD) to identify the right service boundaries, so each microservice “does one thing well” and aligns tightly with a business capability.[1][2]

## Use cases and key patterns

- **Use cases**  
  - Complex domains (e‑commerce, logistics, fintech, IoT, SaaS platforms) where incorrect boundaries cause chatty services, duplicated logic, and hard‑to‑evolve systems.[3][4][1]
  - Migrating monoliths to microservices by decomposing into subdomains and bounded contexts instead of arbitrary technical slices.[2][5]

- **Key domain‑modeling steps (Azure guidance)**  
  - Analyze the domain with business experts to build a **domain model** and ubiquitous language.[4][1]
  - Define **bounded contexts**: coherent subdomains (e.g., Orders, Billing, Fleet Management) that each own their own model.[1][2]
  - Within each bounded context, define **entities, value objects, aggregates, domain services** (tactical DDD).[6][1]
  - Identify microservices: in general, a microservice should not cross a bounded context boundary.[7][2]

## Related design patterns

- **DDD strategic patterns** – Bounded Contexts, Context Map, Core/Supporting/Generic subdomains to prioritize where to invest and how services relate.[5][4][1]
- **DDD tactical patterns** – Entities, Value Objects, Aggregates, Domain Services, Repositories inside each microservice.[8][9][6]
- **Microservice patterns** – Database per Service, Saga/Compensating Transactions, CQRS, Event Sourcing, and Anti‑corruption Layer to integrate between contexts.[10][11][4]

Mention explicitly: “Start from DDD (strategic + tactical), then map bounded contexts to microservices and use Saga/CQRS/etc. between them.”[6][2][1]

## Azure vs AWS implementation

- **Azure (DDD‑oriented microservices)**  
  - Azure guidance uses a “Drone Delivery” example to show: domain analysis → bounded contexts (e.g., Scheduling, Drone Management, Accounts) → aggregates/services → microservice boundaries.[2][1]
  - Implementation:  
    - One microservice per bounded context (or per major part of it), hosted on AKS/Container Apps/App Service.[12][13]
    - Each service owns its data store (Cosmos DB, Azure SQL, Storage, etc.).[10][12]
    - Context boundaries enforced via APIs and messaging (Service Bus/Event Grid) rather than shared tables.[14][10]

- **AWS (DDD‑aligned microservices)**  
  - AWS Well‑Architected and Prescriptive Guidance recommend building services around **business domains and bounded contexts**, mirroring Azure’s approach.[15][16][5]
  - Implementation:  
    - Services per domain/subdomain hosted on ECS/EKS/Lambda.[17][15]
    - Domain‑based data ownership with DynamoDB/RDS etc. per service.[15][17]
    - Domain events and async integration via SNS/SQS/EventBridge.[17][15]

The modeling approach (DDD, bounded contexts) is cloud‑agnostic; Azure and AWS differ mainly in service names.[18][1][15]

## Cheat‑sheet (Q&A style)

**Q1: What is domain modeling for Azure microservices?**  
A: It’s applying DDD (strategic + tactical) to design microservices so each service aligns with one bounded context, has a cohesive domain model, and maps directly to a business capability.[1][6][2]

**Q2: Why start with domain modeling instead of cutting by technical layers?**  
A: Slicing by UI/DB/“CRUD” leads to tight coupling and cross‑cutting changes; slicing by business domains and bounded contexts gives autonomy, clearer ownership, and better change isolation.[19][3][1]

**Q3: What are bounded contexts and how do they relate to microservices?**  
A: A bounded context defines where a particular domain model applies; usually, one microservice maps to one bounded context (or a coherent part of it) and never mixes models from multiple contexts.[4][2][1]

**Q4: Which tactical DDD patterns matter per microservice?**  
A: Entities and value objects model state; aggregates define consistency boundaries; domain services hold domain logic not naturally belonging to an entity; repositories encapsulate persistence.[9][8][6]

**Q5: How is this implemented on Azure?**  
A: Do domain analysis → define bounded contexts → assign each to one or more services on AKS/App Service → give each its own data store (Cosmos/SQL) → coordinate cross‑context workflows via messaging (Service Bus/Event Grid) using Saga/CQRS where needed.[12][2][10][1]

**Q6: How would you do a similar DDD‑based design on AWS?**  
A: Apply the same DDD process, then implement each bounded context as services on ECS/EKS/Lambda with their own DBs (DynamoDB/RDS), and integrate via SNS/SQS/EventBridge; use Saga/Event Sourcing/CQRS patterns for cross‑context flows.[16][5][15][17]

**Q7: How do you know if a microservice boundary is wrong?**  
A: Symptoms: services frequently change together, excessive synchronous chatty calls, shared database tables across services, or mixing different domain concepts in one service.[7][3][2]

**Q8: How do you decompose a monolith using DDD?**  
A: Discover subdomains (core/supporting/generic), define bounded contexts, map existing modules to these contexts, then incrementally carve them out as independent services (often using Strangler Fig).[20][5][4]

**Q9: What interview‑level trade‑offs should you mention?**  
A: Upfront modeling effort and need for close business collaboration vs. long‑term benefits in evolvability, clear ownership, independent scaling, and reduced coupling; over‑fine boundaries can create unnecessary complexity.[15][4][1]

**Q10: What’s a strong example answer?**  
A: “For a ride‑sharing system, run domain analysis to identify contexts like Trips, Payments, Drivers, and Pricing; each becomes its own bounded context and microservice, with separate data and APIs; cross‑context flows (trip lifecycle) are handled with Sagas and domain events on Service Bus/EventBridge.”[2][1][15]

## Data structures and algorithms

- **Data structures**  
  - Domain model objects: entities and value objects capturing domain concepts per bounded context.[6][1]
  - Aggregate roots enforcing invariants and acting as transactional boundaries inside a service.[8][6]
  - Context maps and relationship diagrams (e.g., Customer Management ↔ Billing ↔ Shipping) to visualize bounded contexts and their integrations.[4][1]

- **Algorithms / techniques**  
  - No special low‑level algorithms; focus is on **partitioning and consistency**:  
    - Designing aggregates for invariants with simple transactional updates.[6]
    - Using Sagas and event‑driven workflows for cross‑aggregate/context processes.[11][5]
    - Applying decomposition heuristics (e.g., by subdomain, by change/failure coupling) to refine boundaries iteratively.[2][15]

Interview emphasis should be on modeling and partitioning logic, not on complex DS/Algo.[1][2]

## Concise bullet summary (keywords & terms)

- Domain‑Driven Design (DDD): **strategic DDD** (subdomains, bounded contexts, context maps) + **tactical DDD** (entities, value objects, aggregates, domain services, repositories).[3][1][6]
- Bounded context as natural microservice boundary; microservice should rarely span multiple contexts.[4][2]
- Azure: domain analysis → bounded contexts → microservice boundaries → AKS/App Service/Functions + per‑service data (Cosmos/SQL) + Service Bus/Event Grid integration.[14][10][12][1]
- AWS: same DDD modeling → ECS/EKS/Lambda services per domain → per‑service data (DynamoDB/RDS) → SNS/SQS/EventBridge for events and workflows.[5][16][17][15]
- Related patterns: Database per Service, Saga/Compensating Transaction, CQRS, Event Sourcing, Anti‑corruption Layer, Strangler Fig for migration.[11][20][10][4]
