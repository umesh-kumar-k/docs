Microservices integration testing verifies service interactions without full end-to-end fragility using contract tests, component isolation, and real dependencies via containers.[1][2]

## Key Patterns
Consumer-driven contracts (Pact) define provider-consumer APIs; component tests spin up single services with Testcontainers for DB/message queues.  Service virtualization mocks external deps; integration in CI/CD with can-i-deploy gates; mutation testing validates test coverage.[2][3][4][1]

## Use Cases & Tools
E-commerce tests payment-inventory flows without real prod DBs; streaming validates recommendation API contracts pre-deploy.  Tools: Pact Broker for contract sharing, Testcontainers for Dockerized deps (Postgres/Kafka), WireMock for HTTP mocks, Cucumber for BDD, ArchUnit for architectural tests, Jenkins/GitHub Actions for pipelines.[3][5][6][2]

Big tech refs: Netflix Spinnaker pipelines with contract testing accelerating safe deploys (netflixtechblog.com); Spotify Backstage golden paths standardizing tests across squads (eng.uber.com patterns).[7][8]

## Trade-offs & Questions
Contract tests catch API breaks fast but miss impl bugs; Testcontainers add spin-up time (30s+) vs mocks' instant but fake realism.  E2E tests validate full flows yet flake on deps—limit to critical paths.[9]

- Contract vs integration? (Contract: API shape; integration: full stack incl DB)[1]
- Pact flow? (Consumer generates contract → provider verifies in CI)[3]
- Testcontainers vs in-memory? (Real deps for accuracy, slower)[6]

## Cheat-Sheet Q&A
**Q: Consumer-driven contract?** A: Consumer specs expectations, provider verifies[1]
**Q: Can-i-deploy?** A: Pact Broker gate before promotion[3]
**Q: Test pyramid shift?** A: More unit/component, fewer E2E[4]
**Q: Service virtualization?** A: Mock external APIs (WireMock)[2]
**Q: Mutation testing?** A: Kill mutants to validate test strength[2]

## Data Structures & Algorithms
Graphs model service deps (BFS for test order, cycles detection); queues simulate async events. Hashmaps cache contracts; topological sort sequences parallel tests.
