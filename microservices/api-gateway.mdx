An API Gateway is a reverse proxy that sits between clients and microservices, acting as a single entry point for routing, aggregation, security, and cross‑cutting concerns.[1][2]

## Use cases and key patterns

- **Use cases**  
  - Expose many microservices as a unified API to web/mobile/partner clients, hiding internal topology and protocols.[3][1]
  - Centralize auth, TLS, rate limiting, logging, and request shaping instead of duplicating these in every service.[4][1]

- **Key patterns**  
  - **Request routing & fan‑out**: map paths/verbs to backends; some calls proxy to a single service, others fan‑out and aggregate responses.[2][1]
  - **Gateway offloading**: SSL termination, mTLS, auth, IP allow/block lists, rate limiting, logging/metrics, caching, and WAF at the gateway layer.[5][1][4]
  - **Client‑specific APIs (BFF variation)**: different routes/payloads per client type (web, mobile, 3rd‑party) while reusing the same internal services.[6][2][5]

## Related design patterns

- **Backends for Frontends (BFF)** – per‑client gateways or routes that tailor APIs to each client’s needs; considered a variation of API Gateway.[6][2][5]
- **Service mesh** – handles east‑west (service‑to‑service) traffic; API Gateway is primarily north‑south (client‑to‑service).[7][3][4]
- **Strangler Fig / Anti‑corruption Layer** – gateway is a natural place to route some paths to legacy systems and others to new microservices during migration.[8][9]

Stating “API Gateway + BFF + service mesh + Strangler Fig” shows good architectural breadth in interviews.[10][3][2]

## Azure vs AWS implementation

- **Azure**  
  - Azure guidance: place an API gateway as a reverse proxy between clients and microservices; offload cross‑cutting concerns there, avoid putting domain logic into the gateway.[1][3]
  - Common options:  
    - **Azure API Management (APIM)** for external/public APIs and centralized management: policies for auth, rate limiting, caching, transformations, and versioning.[11][1]
    - **Azure Application Gateway / Front Door** in front for TLS offload, WAF, and global routing, with APIM behind or alongside.[3][8]
    - Backends: AKS, Container Apps, App Service, Functions, or legacy systems; routes defined per path/version/client.[12][13]

- **AWS**  
  - AWS Prescriptive Guidance describes the same pattern: Amazon **API Gateway** (or ALB) as a single endpoint mapping to many internal microservices (Lambda, ECS, EKS, EC2).[14][15]
  - API Gateway provides auth, throttling, request/response transformation, usage plans, and logging to CloudWatch.[15][14]
  - Architectures may use one shared gateway, or multiple gateways per domain/client; patterns mirror Azure APIM.[16][14]

Concepts are identical; cloud choice mostly affects product names and configuration styles.[14][1]

## Cheat‑sheet (Q&A style)

**Q1: What is the API Gateway pattern in microservices?**  
A: A gateway is a single entry point that receives client requests, applies cross‑cutting policies (auth, TLS, throttling, logging), routes and sometimes aggregates calls to back‑end microservices, and returns a unified response.[2][1][14]

**Q2: Why use an API Gateway instead of clients calling services directly?**  
A: To hide internal service topology, centralize security and policies, reduce chattiness, and provide client‑specific APIs without coupling frontends to service details.[5][3][2]

**Q3: How is API Gateway implemented on Azure?**  
A: Use Azure API Management (often with App Gateway/Front Door) as the gateway; define routes and policies that forward to AKS/App Service/Functions; offload TLS, auth, rate limiting, logging, and caching.[13][12][11][1]

**Q4: How is it implemented on AWS?**  
A: Use Amazon API Gateway (plus ALB/NLB where needed) as the entry point; define routes and integrations to Lambda/ECS/EKS; configure auth, throttling, transformation, and monitoring via CloudWatch.[17][15][14]

**Q5: What is the difference between API Gateway and BFF?**  
A: API Gateway is a generic entry point; BFF is a variation where separate gateways or logical routes exist per client type (web, mobile, 3rd‑party) to tailor APIs and payloads.[6][2][5]

**Q6: What should *not* go into the gateway?**  
A: Domain/business logic and heavy orchestration; Azure guidance warns that putting domain rules in the gateway couples services and turns the gateway into a monolith.[10][1][3]

**Q7: How does API Gateway interact with service mesh?**  
A: Gateway handles client‑facing traffic; mesh (e.g., Istio/App Mesh) handles service‑to‑service traffic using sidecars; together they cover north‑south and east‑west concerns.[4][7][3]

**Q8: What are trade‑offs of using an API Gateway?**  
A: Pros: security, central governance, simplified clients. Cons: extra hop and potential bottleneck/single point of failure, plus risk of overloading gateway with domain logic.[18][1][2]

**Q9: Can you have multiple API Gateways?**  
A: Yes—per domain or per client (BFF) as described in microservices.io and AWS guidance; this can improve autonomy and scaling but adds governance complexity.[16][14][2]

**Q10: Example interview narrative?**  
A: “Clients hit APIM in Azure, which terminates TLS, validates JWTs, enforces rate limits, and routes to AKS/App Service microservices; some endpoints aggregate data from multiple services; we use different APIM products/BFFs for public web vs partner APIs.”[13][11][1]

## Data structures and algorithms

- **Data structures**  
  - Routing configuration: path/method → backend service; sometimes including host, version, and client type metadata.[1][14]
  - Policy definitions: auth schemes, rate‑limit rules, caching policies, and transformations stored as configuration (YAML/JSON/policies).[11][1]

- **Algorithms / techniques**  
  - Request routing and load‑balancing (round‑robin, least‑connections) from gateway to service instances.[5][4]
  - Rate limiting (token bucket/leaky bucket) and WAF rules at gateway edge.[19][4][1]
  - Response aggregation/“fan‑in”: gateway calls multiple backends in parallel and merges responses for composite endpoints.[2][4]

The complexity is mostly configuration and composition logic rather than advanced DS/Algo.[18][1]

## Tools / frameworks / software examples

- **Azure**  
  - Azure API Management (APIM), Azure Application Gateway, Azure Front Door; microservices on AKS, Container Apps, App Service, Functions behind the gateway.[3][13][11][1]

- **AWS**  
  - Amazon API Gateway (REST/HTTP/WebSocket), ALB/NLB; backends on Lambda, ECS, EKS, EC2; CloudFront/WAF for edge.[15][17][14]

- **General**  
  - NGINX, Kong, Envoy, Gloo, Apigee, and similar gateways implementing the same pattern.[4][18]

## Concise bullet summary (keywords & terms)

- API Gateway pattern = single entry point; reverse proxy; request routing + aggregation + cross‑cutting concerns.[1][2]
- Offloaded functions: TLS/mTLS, auth, IP filtering, rate limiting, logging/metrics, caching, WAF, static content.[5][4][1]
- Azure: Azure API Management, App Gateway, Front Door in front of AKS/App Service/Functions.[11][3][1]
- AWS: Amazon API Gateway + ALB/NLB fronting Lambda/ECS/EKS; CloudWatch for observability.[17][14][15]
- Variants: Backends for Frontends (per‑client gateways), multiple gateways vs single gateway; gateway vs service mesh roles.[7][14][2]
