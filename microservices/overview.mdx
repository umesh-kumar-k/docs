Microservices architecture decomposes applications into independently deployable services organized by business capabilities, enabling scalability and resilience over monoliths.[1][2]

## Key Patterns
Database-per-service ensures loose coupling with polyglot persistence; API Gateway aggregates routes and handles cross-cutting concerns like auth.  Saga orchestrates distributed transactions via compensating actions; CQRS separates read/write models for scale; Service Mesh (sidecars) manages traffic, resilience, and observability.  Strangler Fig incrementally migrates monoliths; Bulkhead isolates failures.[2][3][4][1]

## Use Cases & Tools
E-commerce decouples orders/inventory for independent scaling; streaming handles peak loads via per-service autoscaling.  Tools: Kubernetes/Docker Swarm for orchestration, Istio/Linkerd service meshes, Spring Cloud/Quarkus frameworks, Consul/Etcd for discovery, Kafka/RabbitMQ for async events, Helm for deployments.[5][6][7]

Big tech refs: Netflix TechBlog on 700+ services boosting deploy velocity post-2008 outage (netflixtechblog.com); Uber's migration scaling rides to millions daily; Amazon's polyglot persistence improving checkout throughput.[8][9][5]

## Trade-offs & Questions
Independent deploys accelerate velocity but spike ops overhead (networking, monitoring); eventual consistency trades ACID for availability.  Fine-grained scalability shines but risks distributed monolith if boundaries blur.[10][2]

- Monolith vs microservices migration? (Strangler pattern, start non-customer-facing)[5]
- Saga vs 2PC? (Saga for availability, 2PC blocks on failures)[2]
- Service mesh overhead? (5-10% CPU for sidecars, offsets with centralized resilience)[6]

## Cheat-Sheet Q&A
**Q: Bounded context?** A: DDD subdomains per service for cohesion[1]
**Q: Circuit breaker state?** A: Closed→Open (fail-fast)→Half-Open (test)[2]
**Q: API composition?** A: Gateway aggregates multiple service calls[3]
**Q: Backends for Frontends?** A: Tailored APIs per client type[4]
**Q: Event sourcing?** A: Append-only log for state reconstruction[2]

## Data Structures & Algorithms
Graphs model service dependencies (DFS/BFS for impact analysis, topological sort for deploy order); consistent hashing rings distribute load across nodes.  Bloom filters approximate service discovery caches; CRDTs (conflict-free replicated data types) enable eventual consistency.[11][12]
