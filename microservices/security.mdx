Microservices security addresses authentication, authorization, and data protection across distributed services using layered patterns like edge gateways and service meshes.[1]

## Key Patterns
Edge-level authorization centralizes checks at API gateways with coarse policies, while service-level uses PDP/PEP models: decentralized (code-level), centralized single PDP (remote decisions), or embedded PDP (local policy cache).  Identity propagation employs signed structures like Netflix's "Passport" (HMAC-protected user context) over raw tokens; service-to-service uses mTLS or token-based auth.  Logging follows stdout-to-agent-to-broker for resilience, with correlation IDs and sanitization.[2][1]

## Use Cases & Tools
E-commerce enforces per-service RBAC for orders/inventory; streaming secures user personalization via propagated identity.  Tools: Keycloak/OPA for centralized authz, Istio service mesh for mTLS/authorization policies, Spring Security OAuth2/JWT, Kong API Gateway, Fluentd/Fluent Bit for logging to Kafka/ELK.[3][4][2][1]

Big tech refs: Netflix TechBlog on Passport for identity propagation and OPA-embedded PDP scaling authorization across 1000s of services (netflixtechblog.com); AWS on mTLS in EKS for secure inter-pod comms improving auditability.[5][6][7]

## Trade-offs & Questions
Embedded PDP cuts latency vs remote PDP's HA needs but risks stale policies; mTLS excels in trust but burdens key rotation vs tokens' simplicity.  OAuth2 scales delegation but adds token validation overhead.[1]

- PDP vs PEP roles? (PDP decides, PEP enforces)[1]
- Edge-only authz risks? (Bypass, single failure; mitigate with mTLS)[1]
- Passport vs JWT propagation? (Passport internal-only, token-agnostic)[5]

## Cheat-Sheet Q&A
**Q: Recommended service auth?** A: mTLS for mutual identity + TLS encryption[1]
**Q: Logging flow?** A: Microservice stdout → agent → broker (Kafka) → central[1]
**Q: Identity propagation?** A: Edge signs "Passport" with user claims, propagates internally[1]
**Q: Defense in depth?** A: Gateway coarse + service fine + code-specific[1]
**Q: Token validation?** A: Offline (local key) for low-latency, online for revocation[1]

## Data Structures & Algorithms
Graphs model service call chains for anomaly detection (BFS/DFS traversal); JWT claims use JSON trees for policy evaluation.  Caching employs LRU (hashmap + doubly-linked list) for PDP decisions; Bloom filters approximate token revocation checks to minimize DB hits.[2][1]
