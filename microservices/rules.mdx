Microservices commandments enforce loose coupling, autonomy, and resilience through principles like single responsibility, no shared persistence, and self-discovery to avoid distributed monoliths.[1][2]

## Key Patterns
Stateless services with dedicated DBs per service; lightweight async messaging (gRPC/Kafka) over shared libs; self-registration via Consul/Eureka; explicit policy checks at boundaries; polyglot stacks with independent CI/CD pipelines.  IDEALS framework: Interface segregation, Deployability, Event-driven, Availability>Consistency, Loose-coupling, Single responsibility.[2][3][1]

## Use Cases & Tools
E-commerce isolates payments/inventory DBs for independent scaling; Netflix applies commandments post-2008 outage for 700+ resilient services.  Tools: Docker/Kubernetes for isolation, Consul for discovery, Kafka for events, Istio for traffic/policy enforcement, ArgoCD for GitOps deploys.[4][5][6][2]

Big tech refs: Netflix TechBlog on commandments enabling chaos-safe deploys (netflixtechblog.com); Uber Eng on polyglot + no-affinity cutting scaling pains (eng.uber.com).[5][6]

## Trade-offs & Questions
Polyglot boosts fit but spikes ops tooling; event-driven ensures availability yet complicates debugging vs sync—use traces.  No shared DBs prevent coupling but demand sagas for consistency.[3][2]

- Shared DB risks? (Coupling kills autonomy, single failure)[1]
- Polyglot vs monostack? (Fit-for-purpose vs uniform tooling)[1]
- Stateless enforcement? (Externalize sessions to Redis/Kafka)[2]

## Cheat-Sheet Q&A
**Q: Commandment 1?** A: Stateless/stateful separation[1]
**Q: No shared libs?** A: Dependency hell avoided[1]
**Q: Self-registration?** A: Eureka/Consul dynamic discovery[1]
**Q: IDEALS core?** A: Interface/Deploy/Event/Avail/Loose/Single[3]
**Q: Polyglot benefit?** A: Best tool per domain[1]

## Data Structures & Algorithms
Consistent hashing for service discovery rings; graphs for dependency mapping (topo sort deploys); CRDTs for eventual consistency. Bloom filters optimize policy caches.
