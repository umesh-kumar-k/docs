Below is a compact “keywords sheet” for **Background Jobs & Async Processing**, optimized for quick pre‑interview skims.[1]

***

## Core concepts

- Background job / worker  
- Asynchronous processing / async workflows  
- Fire‑and‑forget  
- Long‑running process  
- Batch job / batch processing  
- CPU‑intensive vs IO‑intensive jobs  
- Workflow / orchestration  

***

## Triggers & initiation

- Event‑driven trigger  
- Schedule‑driven trigger  
- Queue message trigger  
- Storage change trigger  
- HTTP/API trigger / webhook  
- Timer / cron / scheduled task  

***

## Communication & status

- Command / job request  
- Job ID / correlation ID  
- Status store (status table, job metadata)  
- Reply queue / response queue  
- Callback / push notification  
- Status / health endpoint  

***

## Hosting & execution environments

- Background worker service  
- Web app with background runner  
- Serverless functions (short‑lived jobs)  
- Virtual machines / services  
- Containers, Kubernetes Jobs / CronJobs  
- Batch processing platform  

***

## Patterns & building blocks

- Queue‑based load leveling  
- Competing consumers  
- Leader election  
- Singleton job vs multi‑instance workers  
- Pipes and Filters (multi‑step pipeline)  
- Scheduler Agent Supervisor (orchestration + recovery)  
- Compensating transaction (undo failed workflows)  

***

## Reliability & correctness

- At‑least‑once delivery  
- Idempotent processing  
- Checkpointing / progress persistence  
- Poison messages  
- Dead letter queue  
- Dequeue count / retry count  
- Ordering / sequence numbers  

***

## Scaling & partitioning

- Autoscaling workers (queue length, CPU, schedule)  
- Separately scaling UI vs background workers  
- Work partitioning / sharding  
- Resource contention / pessimistic locking  
- Throughput vs latency for jobs  

***

## Quality attributes & trade‑off terms

- Availability  
- Scalability  
- Resiliency  
- Security isolation  
- Performance / latency  
- Manageability  
- Cost vs capacity  

These terms cover the main vocabulary expected when discussing background jobs and async processing in senior system design interviews.[1]
