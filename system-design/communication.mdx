Sync communication (HTTP/REST request-response) suits queries needing immediate data with tight coupling; async (messaging/queues/events) enables loose coupling, resilience, and scalability by avoiding request chains—prioritize async between microservices for autonomy, using eventual consistency via data replication .

## Interview Summary
- Core distinction: Sync blocks caller until response (simple for queries); async decouples via queues/events (fire-and-forget, non-blocking) .
- Microservices rule: Minimize inter-service sync calls; use async for commands/updates (events propagate changes), replicate needed data locally for queries to avoid chains .
- Design flow: Classify ops (query=REST, command=async), choose single vs multi-receiver, implement eventual consistency (integration events), add resilience (retries, dead-letter queues) .

## Keywords & Patterns (bullet-heavy)
- Communication axes: sync (HTTP blocks protocol) vs async (AMQP non-blocking); single-receiver (commands) vs multi-receiver (pub/sub events) .
- Sync patterns: request-response (REST/gRPC), real-time push (WebSockets/SignalR) .
- Async patterns: messaging (queues point-to-point), pub/sub (topics/fan-out), event-driven (integration events), polling (HTTP for async) .
- Anti-patterns: sync chains (cascading failures), chatty RPC (fine-grained calls) .
- Resilience: circuit breakers, retries (exponential backoff), sagas (distributed tx), dead-letter queues, idempotency .
- Data handling: eventual consistency, data duplication (per Bounded Context), CQRS (separate read/write models) .

## Common Trade-offs + Example Questions
- Trade-offs:  
  - Sync: simplicity/debugging vs tight coupling/cascades (one failure kills chain), low latency vs poor scalability .  
  - Async: loose coupling/resilience/scalability vs eventual consistency (debugging complexity), higher latency vs fault isolation.[1]
  - Eventual consistency: autonomy vs strong consistency (locking/blocking) .
- Example questions:  
  - "Design order service—how to notify inventory/shipping without blocking checkout?" .  
  - "Sync chain failure at scale—mitigate with async?" .  
  - "Query data owned by another service—replicate or call?" .

## Use Cases
- Sync-first: UI queries (user profile fetch), real-time (live scores via SignalR), simple command-response (payment auth) .
- Async-first: fan-out (post→followers), background tasks (report gen, notifications), cross-service updates (order→inventory), high-throughput (analytics pipelines).[1]
- Hybrid: Client sync to API gateway → async between services; queries local DB (replicated), commands via events .

## Big-Company Articles & Applications
- Netflix: Async messaging across 100s microservices for independent scaling; queues isolate failures, enabling massive throughput without cascades.[1]
- Uber: Avoided sync chains in Tincup (chat service)—async prevents ripple failures; CRISP tool analyzes critical paths in mixed sync/async.[2][3]
- AWS: SQS/SNS/EventBridge for point-to-point/pub-sub in microservices; e.g., e-commerce order→payment/shipping fan-out improves resilience/scalability.[4][5]

## Tools, Frameworks & Software Examples
- Sync: REST (ASP.NET Core Web API/Spring Boot), gRPC (high-perf binary), SignalR/WebSockets (real-time) .
- Async messaging: RabbitMQ/AMQP (queues), Kafka (streams/events), Azure Service Bus (topics), AWS SQS/SNS/EventBridge.[6]
- Service mesh: Istio/Envoy (manages sync/async traffic), Spring Cloud Netflix (Feign/Hystrix for sync).[7]
- Orchestration: Kubernetes (sidecar proxies), MassTransit/NServiceBus (abstractions).[6]

## Cheat-sheet (Q&A Style)
- Q: Sync vs async protocol? A: Sync (HTTP) blocks until response; async (AMQP) fire-and-forget .  
- Q: Microservices golden rule? A: Async inter-service; no sync dependencies in request path .  
- Q: Handle foreign data? A: Replicate via events (eventual consistency), not sync query .  
- Q: Single vs multi-receiver? A: Commands=queues (one), events=pub/sub (many) .  
- Q: Cascade failure fix? A: Async + circuit breaker + sagas .  
- Q: REST for async? A: Yes, via polling or outbox pattern .

## Key Highlights / Possible Interview Questions / Tradeoffs
- Highlights: "Smart endpoints, dumb pipes"—decouple services; async = resilience/scalability; duplicate data per context .
- Questions: "eShop checkout—async order propagation?" / "Eventual consistency tradeoffs?" / "Kafka vs RabbitMQ for events?".[1]
- Tradeoffs: Sync (easy, coupled) vs async (resilient, complex); monitor queues for backlogs.[1]
