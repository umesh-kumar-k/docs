title: "High Availability (HA) - Summary"
description: "Concise reference for designing highly available systems: definitions, core principles, strategies, trade‑offs, tools, and interview‑ready cheat sheets."
notes: |
    - Audience: system designers, SREs, and candidates preparing for system-design interviews.
    - Purpose: serve as an Obsidian/MDX-friendly HA section with quick checklists, implementation concerns, and sample questions.
    - Usage tips:
        - Start answers by stating SLO/SLA targets (nines) and acceptable RTO/RPO.
        - Walk through failure modes, redundancy, detection, and failover sequence when designing.
        - Keep cost/complexity trade-offs explicit.

## Core concepts

- High availability (HA)  
- Uptime, downtime  
- Availability percentage, “nines of availability” (99.9, 99.99, 99.999)  
- SLA, SLO, SLI  
- RTO (Recovery Time Objective)  
- RPO (Recovery Point Objective)  

***

## Failure and risk vocabulary

- Single point of failure (SPOF)  
- Fault, failure, incident, outage  
- Degraded mode / graceful degradation  
- Fault tolerance vs high availability  
- Disaster recovery (DR)  
- Region failure, AZ (availability zone) failure, node failure, network partition  

***

## Redundancy and replication

- Redundancy (N+1, N+2)  
- Active‑active vs active‑passive  
- Hot standby, warm standby, cold standby  
- Replication, replicas  
- Synchronous vs asynchronous replication  
- Leader–follower / primary–replica  
- Quorum, majority, consensus  

***

## Scaling and traffic handling

- Horizontal scaling, vertical scaling  
- Load balancing (L4, L7)  
- Round robin, least connections, weighted round robin  
- Health checks, heartbeat  
- Connection draining  
- Session affinity / sticky sessions  
- Global load balancing, anycast, DNS‑based routing  

***

## Data and storage HA

- Distributed data storage  
- Sharding / partitioning  
- Multi‑AZ deployment  
- Multi‑region deployment  
- Read replicas, write master  
- Eventual consistency, strong consistency  
- CAP theorem (consistency, availability, partition tolerance)  

***

## Clustering and orchestration

- Failover clustering  
- Cluster membership, leader election  
- Fencing, split‑brain  
- Kubernetes Deployment, StatefulSet, ReplicaSet  
- Auto‑healing, auto‑scaling  
- Control plane HA, etcd HA  

***

## Resilience patterns (app layer)

- Circuit breaker  
- Retry with backoff, jitter  
- Timeout, bulkhead  
- Idempotency  
- Backpressure  
- Graceful shutdown  

***

## Observability and operations

- Monitoring (metrics, logs, traces)  
- Health endpoints, liveness probe, readiness probe  
- Alerting, on‑call, runbooks  
- SLO‑based alerting (error budget)  
- Chaos engineering, game days  
- Postmortem / incident review  

***

## Change management for HA

- Rolling deployment  
- Blue‑green deployment  
- Canary release  
- Feature flags  
- Maintenance window, planned downtime  

***

## Common technologies (good to name‑drop)

- Load balancers: NGINX, HAProxy, Envoy, cloud LBs (ALB/NLB, etc.)[2][3]
- Databases: PostgreSQL with streaming replication and failover tools, distributed SQL / NoSQL stores with multi‑replica topologies[4][5][6]
- Orchestration: Kubernetes HA clusters, multi‑AZ control planes[7][8]

You can paste this into Obsidian and mark items you feel weak on; for each system design question, quickly scan this list and mentally tick which levers you’re using.
