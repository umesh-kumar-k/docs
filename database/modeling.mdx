## Interview Summary
Data modeling in system design interviews focuses on selecting database types, defining entities with keys and relationships, indexing for access patterns, balancing normalization/denormalization, and planning sharding based on requirements like volume, queries, and consistency. Start by clarifying functional/non-functional needs, then iterate schemas to optimize reads/writes while justifying trade-offs. Senior architects demonstrate reasoning through access patterns over rote patterns.[1][2][3]

## Keywords & Patterns
- **Database Types**: Relational/SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL), Document/NoSQL (MongoDB, Firestore), Key-Value (Redis), Wide-Column (Cassandra), Graph (Neo4j).[3]
- **Keys/Relationships**: Primary Key (PK, system-generated IDs), Foreign Key (FK, referential integrity), 1:N (user→posts), N:M (likes junction), 1:1 (merge tables).[3]
- **Schema Fundamentals**: Normalization (reduce redundancy), Denormalization (embed for reads), Indexes (single/composite on query fields), Constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE).[3]
- **Scaling**: Shard key (match primary access, e.g., user_id), Avoid cross-shard joins, Time-based sharding for feeds.[3]
- **Patterns**: Access-pattern driven design, Eventual consistency for feeds, ACID for transactions.[1]

## Common Trade-offs + Example Questions
**Trade-offs**:
- Normalization saves storage but slows reads via joins; denormalization boosts reads but risks update anomalies and duplication.[3]
- Foreign keys ensure integrity but add write overhead; drop at scale, enforce in app.[3]
- SQL for relations vs. NoSQL for schema flexibility/nesting (trades joins for storage).[3]
- Sharding by user_id avoids cross-shard but complicates global feeds.[3]

**Example Questions**:
- Design schema for social feed: How to handle user posts + likes efficiently?[3]
- When to denormalize post like-counts vs. compute on fly?[1]
- Index strategy for "recent posts by followed users"?[2]

## Use Cases
- **Social Feeds**: Denormalize user posts + follower lists in NoSQL for fast reads; shard by user_id.[3]
- **Analytics**: Wide-column for time-series aggregation (telemetry/IoT).[3]
- **Caching/Sessions**: Key-value for single-key lookups.[3]
- **Financial Txns**: SQL with ACID, normalized for consistency.[3]

## Big Tech Blog References
- Netflix: Data pipelines for recommendations/fraud detection use denormalized models in ML workflows.[4]
- Uber: Michelangelo ML platform employs wide-column/event stores for backtesting/model perf at scale.[4]
- Facebook: Social graph via MySQL (normalized + sharded), avoiding pure graph DBs.[3]

## Cheat-sheet, Q&A Style
- **Q: SQL vs. NoSQL?** A: SQL for relations/ACID; NoSQL for flexible schemas/high writes.[3]
- **Q: Primary access pattern?** A: Shard by it (e.g., user_id for profiles).[3]
- **Q: Index posts by user + time?** A: Composite (user_id, created_at).[3]
- **Q: Denorm when?** A: Read-heavy, eventual consistency (feeds > txns).[3]
- **Q: Orphaned records?** A: FKs or app logic; drop FKs at scale for perf.[3]

## Data Structures & Algorithms
- **DS**: Trees/Graphs for relationships (joins in SQL, embeddings in NoSQL), Hash tables for key-value/indexes, Arrays/Lists for sorted time-series.[5]
- **Algos**: Hashing for sharding/IDs, Sorting for chronological queries (created_at indexes), Tree traversals for nested data, Aggregations for analytics.[6]

## Tools/Frameworks/Software
| Tool | Use Case | Key Features |
|------|----------|--------------|
| ER/Studio | Enterprise modeling | Collaboration, governance [7] |
| Erwin Data Modeler | Schema design | Forward/reverse engineering, DB sync [8] |
| IBM InfoSphere | Logical models | Metadata analysis, version control (Git) [7] |
| PostgreSQL/MySQL | SQL impl | Relations, indexes [3] |
| MongoDB | Document | Nested data [3] |

## Key Highlights & Possible Interview Questions
**Highlights**: Drive design from access patterns > volume/consistency; justify DB choice + indexes/sharding; show trade-offs verbally.[1][3]
**Questions**: How to scale feeds without cross-shard? Trade-offs of embedding vs. joins? Schema for URL shortener with analytics?[9]

## Concise Summary: Key Terms & Keywords
- Primary/Foreign Keys, Normalization/Denormalization, Indexes (Composite), Sharding (Shard Key), Access Patterns, 1:N/N:M Relationships, Referential Integrity, ACID/Eventual Consistency, SQL/NoSQL/Wide-Column/Key-Value.[3]
